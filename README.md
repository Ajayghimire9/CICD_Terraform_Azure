# CICD_Terraform_Azure

# Data Engineering CI/CD with Azure and Terraform

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices in data engineering using Azure and Terraform. As data pipelines become more complex, efficient and automated deployment becomes crucial. CI/CD offers a systematic approach to managing these challenges.

In this project, we explore how to leverage Azure and Terraform to implement CI/CD in data engineering workflows, ensuring more reliable data pipelines, quicker iterations, and reduced manual errors.
