# CICD_Terraform_Azure

# Data Engineering CI/CD with Azure and Terraform

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices in data engineering using Azure and Terraform. As data pipelines become more complex, efficient and automated deployment becomes crucial. CI/CD offers a systematic approach to managing these challenges.

In this project, we explore how to leverage Azure and Terraform to implement CI/CD in data engineering workflows, ensuring more reliable data pipelines, quicker iterations, and reduced manual errors.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Azure Account with a subscription (you can sign up for a free account [here](https://azure.com/free))
- Azure CLI (download [here](https://aka.ms/azure-cli))
- Terraform CLI (download [here](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html))

## Getting Started
Follow the instructions in the project to set up Azure Storage Account and Azure Data Factory using Terraform. The project includes detailed configuration files and examples for a smooth setup.

## Directory Structure

## Usage
